#summary Discussion on new site design

=TODO=
 * georgen: Publish the mock .psd file

=Official Plan=
 * The site should be hosted on Dreamhost
 * The site should be usable on iPhone, but we shouldn't expend a huge effort on making it perfect.
 * Google Analytics will be used
 * The features section will have a left navbar that shows different screenshots in the content area with accompanying text.
 * The support section will have a FAQ and various text documents
 * The dev section will have offsite links to googlecode, etc.
 * Chrome, Firefox, and Safari are the key targets.

=Proposals=
 * Jekyll for templating?
 * try to use CSS3 transitions for browsers that support it
 * fall back to jQuery UI to do the slide transitions for browsers that don't (or if we can't get CSS3 transitions to work)
 * fall back to static page links for JS-less and CSS3-less browsers
 * Twitter feed?
 * Need to place the donate button somewhere.
 * We shouldn't use the code that's up now - it's all ripped off from another site
 * Use Github issues to discuss site development
 * Store documentation in Github wiki and use a git import to add them to the site. That way, the same content is available on the site and on the wiki
