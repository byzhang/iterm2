#summary How to Report a Bug.

= Steps for Reporting Horrific Bugs =

Sometimes there is a really hairy bug where a simple description does not suffice to reproduce it. In that case, follow these steps.

  * Go to the iTerm menu and select "Toggle Debug Logging".
  * Reproduce your bug (don't take too long, the log gets big fast).
  * Select 'Toggle Debug Logging" again to turn off the log.
  * cd /tmp
  * gzip debug_log.txt
  * Open a [http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/entry new issue].
  * Attach /tmp/debug_log.txt.gz and $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist

Note: the com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file will contain your hostnames and paste history (if you opted to save it to disk). Do not upload it if there is a privacy concern.
