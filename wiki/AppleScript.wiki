iTerm features AppleScript support. It is documented here. Someone who doesn't hate AppleScript should improve this page :)

Note: See trunk/iTerm.scriptSuite for a schema of the supported objects.

<pre>


tell application "iTerm"
	activate
	
	-- Create a new terminal window...
	set myterm to (make new terminal)
	
	-- ... and go on within this one.
	tell myterm
		
		-- Set the terminal size constraints.
		set number of columns to 30
		set number of rows to 30
		
		-- Array/List which will hold all our sessions (empty
		-- by default OFC).
		set sessionList to {}
		
		-- Create a few blank new sessions (will be replaced by
		-- automatic calculations later, so that we'll have a
		-- nice bar full with new tabs.)
		repeat with i from 1 to 2 by 1
			launch session "Default"
		end repeat
		
		-- DEBUG: print the session list.
		return sessionList
		
	end tell
	
	-- set the bounds of the first window to {w, x, y, z}
end tell
