#summary How to report bugs with typing particular characters.

= Introduction =

There are two different ways to debug keyboard problems depending on the version of iTerm2 you are running.

== For release or beta builds ==
  * Quit iterm2.
  * In Terminal, run:
{{{
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 DebugKeyDown -bool YES
}}}
  * Run /Applications/Utilities/Console.app.
  * Set the "filter" field in Console to "keyDown".
  * Run iterm2.
  * Reproduce the bug by typing whatever isn't working right.
  * Quit iterm2
  * In console, press cmd-a to select all and do file->save selection as...
  * Open an issue and attach that file to it.

== For nightly builds ==
Create a debug log:
  * Select iTerm&gt;Toggle debug log
  * Reproduce the bug
  * Select iTerm&gt;Toggle debug log to stop logging
  * Open an issue (if needed) and attach /tmp/debuglog.txt to it.
