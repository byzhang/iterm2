#summary How to download files with iTerm2

= Introduction =

The iTerm2 nightly builds from the master branch as of Jan 6, 2014 have the ability to accept base64-encoded files and download them automatically.


= Details =

Use the following shell script:
{{{
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: download.sh file ..."
  exit 1
fi
for fn in "$@"
do
  if [ -r "$fn" ] ; then
    printf '\033]50;File=name='`echo -n "$fn" | base64`";"
    wc -c "$fn" | awk '{printf "size=%d",$1}'
    printf ":"
    base64 < "$fn"
    printf '\a'
  else
    echo File $fn does not exist or is not readable.
  fi
done
}}}
Usage:

{{{
download.sh /file/to/download
}}}

iTerm2 will add the file to the Downloads menu, where its progress can be tracked. It's not as fast as secure copy, but it's very convenient.
