#summary How to download files with iTerm2

= Introduction =

The iTerm2 nightly builds from the master branch as of Jan 6, 2014 have the ability to accept base64-encoded files and download them automatically.


= Details =

Use the following shell script:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: download.sh filename"
  exit 1
fi
if [ -a $1 ]; then
  printf '\033]50;BeginFile='$1'\n'
  stat -c%s $1
  printf '\a'
  base64 < $1
  printf '\033]50;EndFile\a'
  exit 0
fi

echo File $1 does not exist.
exit 1
}}}

Usage:

{{{
download.sh /file/to/download
}}}

iTerm2 will add the file to the Downloads menu, where its progress can be tracked. It's not as fast as secure copy, but it's very convenient.
