#summary How to report performance issues

= Introduction =

Some users complain of performance issues. I want to fix them. Having specific ways to reproduce these issues helps.


= Details =

  * Open a new issue
  * Attach your ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file to it
  * Tell me what you were doing that was slow. Is it faster in Terminal.app?
  * Create a session log using Shell->Log and attach that to the bug if it would be relevant.
