# Introduction #

The iterm2.com site hasn't changed much since 2011 and has some issues that need attention.


# Goals #
  1. Split the site up into multiple pages. It's currently one giant page and various divs are hidden or shown as you navigate the top-level navigation bar.
  1. Make it pleasant to use on mobile; in general, degrade more gracefully.
  1. Add a second level of navigation to the Documentation page to split it up (General Usage, Highlights for New Users, and Everything Else), plus the following pages:
    * http://www.iterm2.com/coprocesses.html
    * http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html
    * http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html
  1. For some reason, copying text in ` < `pre> from the site loses line breaks, which is really annoying.
  1. Update the Features page to require less clicking around
  1. Add a "News" section to the top-level nav bar.
